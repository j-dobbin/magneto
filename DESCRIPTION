Title: The building blocks for digitization of magnetograms, or images
        alike
Version: 0.9.9.0
Author: Benjamin Ott, with contributions from Mark Weygang and Wesley Burr
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Uses TIS(Trace Identification Through Separation).  We wanted to make
  the functions into building blocks so people can use each part individually to hopefully
  aid in the digitizations for different types of images, rather then just magnetograms.
